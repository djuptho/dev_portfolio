#### Adblock Detection

This code detects if the user is using an ad blocking plugin. By combining my code with some custom Javascript for your platform you can track ad block usage and e.g. provide ("force") alternative ads to the users.

**Platform**: Desktop  
**Made with**: Javascript, HTML, CSS  
**Live demo**: http://djuptho.com/dev/adblock/

#### Live Clock

When using multiple computers screens (e.g. when playing games) it's neat to have a clear live clock one of the screens. The clock updates every second. Remember that this feature requires PHP and needs to be running on a server.  

The background artwork is taken from http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/media/fanart/

**Platform**: Desktop  
**Made with**: PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS  
**Live demo**: http://djuptho.com/dev/clock/

**Platform**: Mobile  
**Made with**: Javascript, HTML, CSS  
**Live demo**: http://djuptho.com/dev/device_detection/

#### Location Coordinates

By clicking the button (and allowing the page to use your location) it will tell you your location. By combining this data to a database you could translate the location to a country or city. This can be used for a more personalized user experience.

**Platform**: Desktop/Mobile  
**Made with**: Javascript, HTML, CSS  
**Live demo**: http://djuptho.com/dev/location_coordinates/

#### Social Share

Sharing web pages in social media is something many sites have implemented for a long time. This special feature works on mobile devices and appears in the lower part of the screen when scrolling down. This could be useful e.g. on a news site.

**Platform**: Mobile  
**Made with**: Javascript, HTML, CSS  
**Live demo**: http://djuptho.com/dev/share/

#### Spotify Prototype

I got dared to make a version of Spotify. This simple web application has a few features and plays a piece of classical music. Works pretty good on a smartphone.

I made this work with CSS3 animations without any Javascript.

When using public wireless internet connections at airports, hotels etc. it's nice to know if the connection is stable and works properly. By using my mobile application, you easily know if you have a connection or not :)
