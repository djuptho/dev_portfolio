#### Adblock Detection

This code detects if the user is using an ad blocking plugin. By combining my code with some custom Javascript for your platform you can track ad block usage and e.g. provide ("force") alternative ads to the users.

**Platform**: Desktop  
**Made with**: Javascript, HTML, CSS

#### Live Clock

When using multiple computers screens (e.g. when playing games) it's neat to have a clear live clock one of the screens. The clock updates every second. Remember that this feature requires PHP and needs to be running on a server.  

The background artwork is taken from http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/media/fanart/
